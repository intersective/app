# Assessment Page (Mobile)

<!-- module: app-v3/pages/assessment-mobile / type: page / status: draft -->

## Overview

The assessment page allows learners to submit answers to assessment questions. It supports multiple question types (slider, single-choice, multiple-choice, text, file upload, team member selectors). Answers are auto-saved periodically (every 10 seconds) to prevent data loss. A submit guard prevents premature submission. Paginated question navigation is supported for long assessments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1**: Assessment loads for the learner's current activity and submission context.
