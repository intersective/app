# Topic Component - Video Playback Issues

## Topic Attention Metrics

### Purpose

Topic tasks now send a non-blocking attention snapshot when an incomplete topic is marked complete. The metric is intended to help understand whether learners likely engaged with the topic content; it is not proof of reading or comprehension.

The learner experience is unchanged in v1:

- The "Mark as complete and continue" action is not blocked or delayed.
- Already completed topics continue without posting another progress update or attention payload.
- No raw topic text, pointer paths, keystrokes, or personal content is sent.

### Payload

`TopicComponent` emits a `TopicContinueEvent` with `{ topic, attention }`. Desktop and mobile pages pass `attention` into `TopicService.updateTopicProgress(id, 'completed', attention)`, which posts:

```json
{
  "model": "topic",
  "model_id": 123,
  "state": "completed",
  "meta": {
    "attention": {
      "version": 1,
      "score": 80,
      "confidence": "high",
      "activeMs": 10000,
      "visibleMs": 10000,
      "estimatedReadMs": 9000,
      "textWordCount": 30,
      "contentExposureRatio": 1,
      "mediaProgressRatio": 0,
      "mediaPlayedMs": 0,
      "filePreviewCount": 0,
      "fileDownloadCount": 0,
      "quickComplete": false
    }
  }
}
```

Backend requirement: `api/v2/motivations/progress/create.json` must accept and persist optional `meta.attention` without changing existing topic progress semantics.

### Signals And Scoring

The tracker uses native browser APIs and existing component interactions:

- Foreground visible time, paused while the document is hidden.
- Quick-complete flag when foreground time is under 5 seconds.
- Word count from the raw topic HTML retained during topic normalisation.
- Maximum rendered content exposure for `app-description`.
- Native audio/video and Plyr media progress/play time where available.
- Attachment preview/download counts from existing file actions.

Applicable signal weights are redistributed when a topic lacks that signal:

- Text exposure: `0.35`
- Reading-time ratio: `0.25`
- Media progress: `0.25`
- File interaction: `0.15`

`score` is `0-100`. `confidence` is `high` at `>= 75`, `medium` at `>= 40`, otherwise `low`. A quick-complete session forces `confidence` to `low` unless the score is already `>= 75`.

### Limitations

- Attention confidence is an engagement heuristic, not a comprehension measure.
- Embedded media providers may expose progress through Plyr inconsistently.
- File interaction counts indicate opening/downloading, not whether the file was read.
- v1 does not revive the old `stopped` progress state or add completion gating.

## Local Topic Time Spent Indicator

### Purpose

Incomplete topic tasks show a small "Time spent" indicator below the topic title. This is a local learner-facing timer and is separate from the backend attention metric.

### Storage And Lifecycle

- Each topic uses localStorage key `topicTimeSpent:<topicId>`.
- In activity navigation, the selected `Task.id` is the authoritative topic id for this key. This avoids continuing the previous topic timer while the next topic content is still loading asynchronously.
- The timer starts when `TopicComponent` receives a topic.
- The timer is persisted and stopped when the component changes topic, is destroyed, or leaves the page.
- Returning to the same topic resumes from the persisted value.
- Marking an incomplete topic complete removes the stored timer for that topic.
- Already completed topics do not show the indicator and do not clear any timer through the continue-only path.
- A direct mobile topic load refreshes the parent activity and matches its task by topic id, so a completed topic keeps its completed state after a browser refresh.

### Format

The visible timer uses `m:ss` until it reaches one hour, then `h:mm:ss`.

## Topic Attention And Completion Flow

The topic interaction is measurement-only in v1. The learner can complete the topic immediately; tracking does not block, delay, or require additional interaction.

```text
Topic loads
  -> start attention tracking for the current topic session
  -> start or resume the local topic time-spent timer

Learner interacts with the topic
  -> accumulate foreground-visible time
  -> record maximum content exposure
  -> record media play time and furthest media progress
  -> record file preview and download actions

Learner selects the completion action
  -> build the aggregate attention snapshot
  -> emit { topic, attention } from TopicComponent
  -> remove the local timer for an incomplete topic

Desktop or mobile page receives the event
  -> if the task is already done, navigate to the next task without posting progress
  -> otherwise post completed topic progress with optional meta.attention
  -> refresh activity state and continue to the next task
```

The UI uses the task status to choose the completion state:

- Incomplete topic: show `Time spent: m:ss` and `Mark as complete and continue`.
- Completed topic: hide the time indicator and show `Continue`.
- Completed topic continuation: skip `updateTopicProgress()` so attention is not submitted repeatedly.

### Measurement Boundaries

The local time-spent timer and backend attention metrics have different purposes and lifecycles:

- `topicTimeSpent:<topicId>` is a learner-facing localStorage value that accumulates across visits to the same topic. It is persisted when the topic is left, the component is destroyed, or the selected topic changes, and is removed when an incomplete topic is completed.
- The `attention` snapshot is created for the current TopicComponent session when the completion action is selected. It is sent only with the first completion request for an incomplete task.
- The accumulated local timer is currently not included in `meta.attention` and does not contribute to the attention score.
- `activeMs` and `visibleMs` currently represent the same foreground-visible session time. Hidden browser tabs pause this attention measurement; the local timer is stopped by page/component lifecycle events.
- The tracker records aggregate interaction signals only. It does not send raw topic HTML, pointer paths, keystrokes, or personal content.

On a direct mobile topic refresh, the page reloads the parent activity and matches the task by the route topic ID before rendering the completion state. This ensures a previously completed topic remains completed after refresh.

## Issue: YouTube Video Overlay Not Loading on Subsequent Visits

### Problem Description
When users visit a topic task with an embedded YouTube video for the first time, the video loads and plays correctly with the Plyr overlay controls. However, when navigating away and returning to the same task (subsequent visit), the Plyr video overlay fails to load, leaving only the raw YouTube iframe without interactive controls.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Date Identified:** January 16, 2026
**Component:** `projects/v3/src/app/components/topic/topic.component.ts`
**Affected Files:**
- `topic.component.ts`
- `topic.component.html`

#### Technical Root Cause

The issue was caused by Angular's change detection not triggering DOM re-rendering when the same HTML content is set, combined with persistent state flags preventing re-initialization:

1. **First Visit Flow (Working):**
   - `ngOnChanges`: Sets `iframeHtml` via `embedService.embed()` with unique iframe ID
   - Template renders: `<div class="video-embed"><iframe id="youtube-embed-...-1768543203090"></iframe></div>`
   - `ngAfterViewChecked`: Queries `.video-embed`, finds it
   - Sets `plyrNeedsInit = false` and `plyrInitialized = true`
   - Calls `_initVideoPlayer()` successfully
   - Plyr wraps the element and adds controls ✅

2. **Subsequent Visit Flow (Broken):**
   - `ngOnChanges`: Calls `cleanupMedia()` to destroy old Plyr instance
   - `cleanupMedia()`: Destroys Plyr, sets `plyrInitialized = false`, sets `iframeHtml = null`
   - `ngOnChanges` continues: Sets `iframeHtml` to same HTML content (new iframe ID but same structure)
   - **Problem:** Angular's change detection sees identical HTML structure, doesn't re-render DOM
   - Template keeps old `.video-embed` div (now without Plyr wrapper after cleanup)
   - Old iframe is replaced with new iframe ID, but DOM structure unchanged
   - `ngAfterViewChecked`: Queries `.video-embed`
   - **Critical Issue:** Selector finds nothing (or finds stale element without proper structure)
   - Condition `if (videoEmbeds.length > 0)` fails
   - `_initVideoPlayer()` never called
   - Video remains without Plyr controls ❌

#### DOM Comparison

**First Visit HTML (Working):**
```html
<div class="video-embed">
  <iframe id="youtube-embed-QO3mTpdGzAk-1768543203090" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QO3mTpdGzAk"></iframe>
</div>
<!-- ngAfterViewChecked finds .video-embed, initializes Plyr -->
```

**Subsequent Visit HTML (Broken):**
```html
<div class="video-embed">
  <iframe id="youtube-embed-QO3mTpdGzAk-1768543271638" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QO3mTpdGzAk"></iframe>
</div>
<!-- ngAfterViewChecked queries .video-embed but finds empty NodeList -->
<!-- Angular didn't re-render because HTML content is structurally identical -->
```

**Key Observation:**
The iframe ID changes (timestamps differ), but Angular's change detection doesn't see this as a meaningful change since the overall HTML structure is identical. The `.video-embed` div element reference becomes stale after cleanup.

### Solution Implemented

The fix addresses the core issue: Angular not re-rendering the `.video-embed` div when the same HTML structure is set, preventing `ngAfterViewChecked` from finding the element on subsequent visits.

#### 1. Force DOM Re-rendering in ngOnChanges
Added explicit change detection trigger to force Angular to clear and re-render the iframe container:

```typescript
ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {
  this.continuing = false;
  if (this.topic && changes.topic) {
    // clean up previous video player instance before loading new topic
    if (changes.topic.previousValue) {
      this.cleanupMedia();
      
      // force template to clear by setting null and triggering change detection
      // this ensures angular removes the old .video-embed div completely
      this.iframeHtml = null;
      this.cdr.detectChanges();  // ⭐ KEY FIX: Forces Angular to remove old DOM
    }
    
    // reset state for new topic
    this.videoNeedsInit = false;
    this.plyrNeedsInit = false;
    this.plyrInitialized = false;

    if (this.topic.videolink) {
      // this may set iframeHtml for youtube/vimeo embeds
      this._setVideoUrlElelemts();
      
      // for native videos or iframe embeds, mark for init
      if (!this.iframeHtml) {
        this.videoSrc = this.topic.videolink;
        this.videoNeedsInit = true;
      } else {
        this.videoSrc = null;
        this.plyrNeedsInit = true;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Why this works:**
- Setting `iframeHtml = null` triggers template's `*ngIf="iframeHtml"` to become false
- Calling `cdr.detectChanges()` forces Angular to process this change immediately
- Template removes the entire `<div class="video-embed">` from DOM
- When `_setVideoUrlElelemts()` sets new `iframeHtml`, it's a fresh insertion
- Angular re-renders the `.video-embed` div from scratch
- `ngAfterViewChecked` now finds the element and initializes Plyr successfully

#### 2. Enhanced cleanupMedia() with Proper Flag Reset
Updated to reset both initialization flags, ensuring clean state for next render:

```typescript
public cleanupMedia() {
  this._pauseResetAndReplaceMediaElements('audio');
  this._pauseResetAndReplaceMediaElements('video');

  // destroy and remove all plyr instances
  const plyrElements = this.document.querySelectorAll('.plyr');
  this.utils.each(plyrElements, (plyrEl: HTMLElement) => {
    if ((plyrEl as any).plyr) {
      try {
        (plyrEl as any).plyr.destroy();
      } catch (e) {
        console.warn('error destroying plyr instance:', e);
      }
      (plyrEl as any).plyr = null;
    }
  });

  // reset plyr initialization flags to allow re-initialization
  this.plyrInitialized = false;
  this.plyrNeedsInit = false;  // ⭐ Also reset this flag

  // nullify iframehtml reference for garbage collection
  this.iframeHtml = null;
}
```

#### 3. Add Duplicate Check in _initVideoPlayer
Prevent double initialization if Plyr wrapper somehow already exists:

```typescript
private _initVideoPlayer() {
  const embedVideos = this.document.querySelectorAll('.video-embed');

  this.utils.each(embedVideos, (embedVideo, index) => {
    // skip native video elements
    if (embedVideo.nodeName === 'VIDEO') {
      return;
    }

    // skip if already has plyr wrapper to prevent double initialization
    if (embedVideo.parentElement?.classList.contains('plyr')) {
      return;  // ⭐ Safety check
    }

    // initialize Plyr...
    const plyrInstance = new Plyr(embedVideo as HTMLElement, {
      // ...config
    });

    // store plyr instance reference for cleanup
    (embedVideo as any).plyr = plyrInstance;  // ⭐ Store for cleanup
    
    // remove poster overlay that blocks video interaction
    const removePoster = () => {
      const wrapper = embedVideo.parentElement;
      const poster = wrapper?.querySelector('.plyr__poster');
      if (poster) {
        poster.remove();
      }
    };

    setTimeout(removePoster, 100);
    plyrInstance.on('ready', removePoster);
    plyrInstance.on('playing', removePoster);
  });
}
```

#### 4. Lifecycle Flow After Fix

**Working Flow (Subsequent Visits):**
1. User navigates to same topic again
2. `ngOnChanges`: Detects `changes.topic.previousValue` exists
3. Calls `cleanupMedia()`: Destroys Plyr, resets all flags
4. Sets `iframeHtml = null` 
5. Calls `cdr.detectChanges()`: Angular removes `.video-embed` div from DOM ⭐
6. Continues: Sets `plyrNeedsInit = false`, `plyrInitialized = false`
7. Calls `_setVideoUrlElelemts()`: Creates new iframe HTML
8. Sets `iframeHtml` with new content
9. Angular's automatic change detection sees new value
10. Template renders fresh `<div class="video-embed">` with new iframe ⭐
11. `ngAfterViewChecked`: Queries `.video-embed`
12. **Success:** Finds the freshly rendered element! ✅
13. Sets flags and calls `_initVideoPlayer()`
14. Plyr initializes successfully with controls

### Implementation Details

**Key Changes in `topic.component.ts`:**

1. **Added ChangeDetectorRef Injection:**
   ```typescript
   constructor(
     // ...other services
     private cdr: ChangeDetectorRef,
     @Inject(DOCUMENT) private readonly document: Document
   ) { }
   ```

2. **Enhanced `ngOnChanges` with Forced Change Detection:**
   ```typescript
   if (changes.topic.previousValue) {
     this.cleanupMedia();
     
     // ⭐ Force DOM clearing
     this.iframeHtml = null;
     this.cdr.detectChanges();  // Critical for re-rendering
   }
   ```

3. **Updated `cleanupMedia` to Reset Both Flags:**
   ```typescript
   this.plyrInitialized = false;
   this.plyrNeedsInit = false;  // Added: was missing before
   ```
- [x] Subsequent visits to SAME task loads Plyr overlay correctly
- [x] Switching between different video tasks works
- [x] Native video elements (non-YouTube) still work
- [x] Vimeo embeds work correctly
- [x] No console errors related to Plyr initialization
- [x] Video controls are fully interactive on all visits
- [x] Cleanup properly destroys old Plyr instances

**Poster Behavior (Updated January 16, 2026):**
- [x] No poster overlay blocks video interaction (Plyr `poster: false` config)
- [x] No console errors about poster removal
- [x] Video plays immediately on click without poster interference

### Debugging Tips

**Check if .video-embed exists in DOM:**
```typescript
ngAfterViewChecked(): void {
  if (this.plyrNeedsInit && !this.plyrInitialized) {
    const videoEmbeds = this.document.querySelectorAll('.video-embed');
    console.log('Looking for .video-embed, found:', videoEmbeds.length);
    if (videoEmbeds.length > 0) {
      // initialization happens...
    }
  }
}
```

**Common Issue Indicators:**
- `videoEmbeds.length === 0` on subsequent visits → Angular not re-rendering
- Plyr wrapper exists but no controls → Plyr initialized but not cleaned up properly
- Multiple Plyr instances on same video → Duplicate initialization, missing safety check
- iframe ID changes but video doesn't work → Template not detecting changes
- Skeleton loader stuck visible → `isVideoLoading` not cleared, check `ngAfterViewChecked`, `onVideoCanPlay`, or `handleVideoError`
- Video appears without fade-in → Check `[@fadeIn]` animation in template

**Verification:**
1. Open developer console
2. Navigate to topic with video → Should see skeleton, then Plyr controls with fade-in
3. Navigate away to another task
4. Return to same video task → Should see skeleton again, then Plyr controls with fade-in
5. Check HTML: `.video-embed` should exist and iframe ID should be different
6. Test error case with invalid video URL → Skeleton should disappear and show error alert

### Console Output

**Expected behavior:**
- Skeleton loader appears while video initializes
- For YouTube/Vimeo: Skeleton visible during iframe load and Plyr initialization
- For native videos: Skeleton visible until `canplay` event fires
- Fade-in animation (300ms) when video becomes visible
- No console errors related to Plyr or poster removal

### Key Learnings

### Files Modified

1. `projects/v3/src/app/components/topic/topic.component.ts`
   - Added `ChangeDetectorRef` injection
   - Added Angular animation imports (`trigger`, `transition`, `style`, `animate`)
   - Added `fadeIn` animation trigger to component decorator
   - Added public `isVideoLoading` flag for loading state management
   - Updated `ngOnChanges`: Added `cdr.detectChanges()` call after setting `iframeHtml = null`, sets `isVideoLoading = true` when video detected
   - Enhanced `cleanupMedia()`: Reset both `plyrInitialized` and `plyrNeedsInit` flags
   - Updated `_initVideoPlayer()`: Added duplicate check, instance storage, removed manual poster removal code (replaced with CSS)
   - Updated `ngAfterViewChecked()`: Clears `isVideoLoading` after Plyr initialization
   - Updated `onVideoCanPlay()`: Clears `isVideoLoading` when native video is ready
   - Updated `handleVideoError()`: Clears `isVideoLoading` on error to prevent stuck state

2. `projects/v3/src/app/components/topic/topic.component.html`
   - Added skeleton loader with `*ngIf="isVideoLoading"`, `role="status"`, and `aria-label="Loading video"` for accessibility
   - Updated iframe embed: Added `*ngIf="!isVideoLoading"` and `[@fadeIn]` animation
   - Updated native video: Added `*ngIf="!isVideoLoading"` condition and `[@fadeIn]` animation

3. `projects/v3/src/app/components/topic/topic.component.scss`
   - Added `.video-skeleton` styles (width: 100%, margin: 20px)
   - Added `.video-skeleton-box` styles (400px height mobile, 450px desktop, 8px border-radius)
   - Added CSS rule to hide Plyr poster overlay: `::ng-deep .plyr__poster { display: none !important; }`
   - Added media query for desktop skeleton sizing

### Key Learnings

1. **Angular Change Detection with [innerHTML]:**
   - Setting `[innerHTML]` to the same HTML structure won't trigger re-render
   - Must explicitly set to `null` first, then call `detectChanges()`
   - This forces template's `*ngIf` to evaluate and remove/re-add the element

2. **Plyr State Management:**
   - Destroying Plyr instance doesn't automatically reset component state flags
   - Both `plyrInitialized` and `plyrNeedsInit` must be reset for re-initialization
   - Storing instance reference on element helps with cleanup and duplicate detection
   - **CSS-based poster hiding** (`::ng-deep .plyr__poster { display: none !important; }`) is more reliable than config or DOM manipulation

3. **Lifecycle Hook Coordination:**
   - `ngOnChanges` handles cleanup and state reset
   - `ngAfterViewChecked` handles detection and initialization
   - Both must work together for proper re-initialization flow

4. **Loading State Management:**
   - Boolean flag (`isVideoLoading`) provides simple state tracking
   - Set true when video detected, clear on ready/error events
   - Skeleton loader consistent with codebase patterns (ion-skeleton-text)
   - Proper accessibility: `role="status"` and internationalized `aria-label`

5. **User Experience Enhancements:**
   - Fade-in animations (300ms) provide polished transitions
   - 16:9 aspect ratio skeleton prevents layout shift
   - Responsive skeleton sizing (400px mobile, 450px desktop)
   - Error handling prevents stuck loading state

### Future Improvements

**Completed Improvements (January 16, 2026):**

1. ✅ **Plyr Poster Configuration**
   - Replaced manual poster removal workaround with CSS-based solution
   - Added `::ng-deep .plyr__poster { display: none !important; }` in component styles
   - Cleaner, more maintainable approach that works reliably across Plyr versions
   - Note: Plyr's TypeScript interface doesn't include a `poster` config option, so CSS is the recommended approach

2. ✅ **Loading Indicator Implementation**
   - Added `isVideoLoading` flag for state management
   - Implemented skeleton loader consistent with existing codebase patterns
   - 16:9 aspect ratio placeholder (400px mobile, 450px desktop)
   - Proper accessibility: `role="status"` and internationalized `aria-label`
   - Added fade-in animation (300ms ease-in) for smooth video appearance
   - Loading state clears on video ready (`canplay` for native, after Plyr init for embeds)
   - Error handling: Loading state clears in `handleVideoError()` to prevent stuck state

**Remaining Future Improvements:**

1. Consider using structural directives with `trackBy` for better change detection
2. Add comprehensive error handling for Plyr initialization failures
3. Consider moving Plyr logic to a dedicated service for reusability
4. Add unit tests for cleanup and re-initialization scenarios
5. Add unit tests for loading state lifecycle
