# Assessment Flow Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of how the Practera AppV2 assessment system works, covering the flow from activity pages through assessment components to form validation and submission handling for both learners and reviewers.

## Architecture Overview

The assessment system follows a hierarchical component structure with clear separation of concerns:

```
Activity Pages (Desktop/Mobile)
    ↓
Assessment Component (Central Hub)
    ↓ (with Pagination enabled)
Page Indicators (non-Team360) / Prev-Next Only (Team360) ←→ Question Groups (Split into Pages) ←→ Navigation Controls
    ↓
Question Components (Text, File, Multiple Choice, etc.)
    ↓
Bottom Action Bar (Submit/Continue Button + Pagination Controls)
```

### Pagination Flow
When pagination is enabled (`environment.featureToggles.assessmentPagination = true` - environment variable file):

```
1. Assessment loads → splitGroupsByQuestionCount()
2. Physical pages generated
   - Team360: one configured group per physical page
   - other assessment types: groups packed into pages of ≤10 questions
3. Non-Team360 page indicators show completion status
4. Users navigate with Prev/Next buttons; non-Team360 users can also click page indicators
5. Team360 assessments hide page numbers/dots and use Prev/Next-only pagination
6. Team360 navigation follows configured group order with one group per physical page
   - selector-free groups are non-peer pages and remain accessible before, between, or after member-review groups
   - member-review groups contain a team-member selector and drive the member progress counter
   - unused member placeholder pages remain inaccessible
7. Form validation tracks every required question on accessible pages, including leading and trailing non-peer groups
8. Submit requires both member-review completion and a valid assessment form
```

## Core Components

### 1. Entry Point Pages

#### Activity Desktop Page (`activity-desktop.page.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Main desktop interface for learners doing assessments
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Manages activity and task navigation
  - Handles assessment loading and submission
  - Controls button states and loading indicators
  - Coordinates with activity service for task progression

**Key Properties:**
```typescript
assessment = this.assessmentService.assessment$;
submission: Submission;
review: AssessmentReview;
savingText$: BehaviorSubject<string> = new BehaviorSubject<string>('');
btnDisabled$: BehaviorSubject<boolean> = new BehaviorSubject<boolean>(false);
```

**Assessment Flow:**
1. Loads assessment via `assessmentService.getAssessment()`
2. Displays assessment component with current data
3. Handles save events from assessment component
4. Manages button states during submission

#### Assessment Mobile Page (`assessment-mobile.page.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Mobile-optimized interface for assessments
- **Similar functionality** to desktop but adapted for mobile UX
- **Key Differences**: 
  - Mobile-specific navigation patterns
  - Touch-optimized interactions
  - Responsive layout adjustments

#### Review Desktop Page (`review-desktop.page.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Interface for reviewers to evaluate learner submissions
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Manages review list and current review selection
  - Handles review submission and feedback
  - Coordinates between review list and assessment components

**Review-Specific Properties:**
```typescript
currentReview: Review;
reviews: Review[];
noReview: boolean = false;
```

### 2. Central Assessment Component (`assessment.component.ts`)

The assessment component is the central hub that orchestrates the entire assessment experience for both learners and reviewers.

#### Core State Management

**Action Types:**
- `'assessment'` - Learner doing assessment or viewing feedback
- `'review'` - Reviewer providing feedback on learner submission

**State Flags:**
```typescript
doAssessment: boolean = false;        // Learner can edit assessment
isPendingReview: boolean = false;     // Reviewer can edit review
feedbackReviewed: boolean = false;    // Learner has seen feedback
```

**Form Management:**
```typescript
questionsForm: FormGroup = new FormGroup({});
// Form controls named 'q-{questionId}' for dynamic question handling
```

#### Data Flow Logic

**For Learners (`action === 'assessment'`):**
1. **Not Started/In Progress**: `doAssessment = true`
   - Form controls are editable
   - Required validators applied to learner-audience questions
   - Auto-save functionality enabled
   - Submit button available

2. **Pending Review**: Read-only mode
   - Form controls disabled
   - Show "waiting for review" message
   - No submit functionality

3. **Feedback Available**: Read-only with feedback
   - Display learner answers and reviewer feedback
   - "Mark as Read" button to acknowledge feedback
   - Navigation to next task after reading

**For Reviewers (`action === 'review'`):**
1. **Pending Review**: `isPendingReview = true`
   - Display learner submission as reference (read-only)
   - Reviewer form controls are editable
   - Required validators applied to reviewer-audience questions
   - "Submit Review" button available

2. **Review Complete**: Read-only mode
   - Show completed review
   - No further editing allowed

#### Form Population Logic

The form population has been refactored to ensure proper timing and validation state management.

**Assessment Answers (`this.action === 'assessment'`):**
```typescript
private _prefillForm(): void {
  // populate form with submission answers (for assessment action)
  if (this.submission?.answers && this.action === 'assessment') {
    Object.keys(this.submission.answers).forEach(questionId => {
      const controlName = 'q-' + questionId;
      const control = this.questionsForm.get(controlName);
      if (control && this.submission.answers[questionId]?.answer !== undefined) {
        control.setValue(this.submission.answers[questionId].answer, { emitEvent: false });
      }
    });
  }

  // populate form with review answers (for review action)
  if (this.review?.answers && this.action === 'review') {
    Object.keys(this.review.answers).forEach(questionId => {
      const controlName = 'q-' + questionId;
      const control = this.questionsForm.get(controlName);
      if (control && this.review.answers[questionId]) {
        const reviewAnswer = {
          answer: this.review.answers[questionId].answer,
          comment: this.review.answers[questionId].comment,
          file: this.review.answers[questionId].file || null,
        };
        control.setValue(reviewAnswer, { emitEvent: false });
      }
    });
  }

  // revalidate form after setting values
  this.questionsForm.updateValueAndValidity();

  // check validation state and update button accordingly
  if (this.doAssessment || this.isPendingReview) {
    // in edit mode, check form validation
    this.setSubmissionDisabled();
  } else {
    // in read-only mode, ensure button is enabled
    this.btnDisabled$.next(false);
  }
}
```

#### Required Field Validation

**Validation Rules:**
- Required validators only applied when user can edit
- `doAssessment = true`: Learner doing assessment
- `isPendingReview = true`: Reviewer doing review
- Read-only modes have no required validation

**Implementation:**
```typescript
private _populateQuestionsForm() {
  this.assessment.groups.forEach(group => {
    group.questions.forEach(question => {
      let validator = [];
      
      // Apply required validator based on user role and edit permissions
      if (this._isRequired(question) === true) {
        validator = [Validators.required];
      }

      this.questionsForm.addControl('q-' + question.id, new FormControl('', validator));
    });
  });

  // Update button state based on form validity
  this.questionsForm.valueChanges.pipe(
    takeUntil(this.unsubscribe$),
    debounceTime(300),
  ).subscribe(() => {
    this.btnDisabled$.next(this.questionsForm.invalid);
  });
}

private _isRequired(question: Question): boolean {
  if (!question.isRequired) return false;
  
  // Check if current user can edit and question applies to them
  if (this.doAssessment && question.audience.includes('submitter')) {
    return true;
  }
  
  if (this.isPendingReview && question.audience.includes('reviewer')) {
    return true;
  }
  
  return false;
}
```

### 3. Question Components

Each question type has its dedicated component that handles specific input requirements:

#### File Upload Component (`app-file-upload`)
**Dual Purpose Display:**
- **Learner View**: Shows upload interface or uploaded file
- **Reviewer View**: Shows learner's file + reviewer's file upload interface

**Key Properties:**
```typescript
[question]="question"                    // Question metadata
[doAssessment]="doAssessment"           // Learner can edit
[doReview]="isPendingReview"            // Reviewer can edit
[submission]="submission?.answers[question.id] || {}"  // Learner's answer
[review]="review?.answers[question.id] || {}"          // Reviewer's answer
[control]="questionsForm?.controls['q-' + question.id]" // Form control
```

**Form Control Updates:**
```typescript
onFileUploaded(file: any) {
  if (this.doReview && this.control) {
    this.control.setValue(file);
    this.control.markAsTouched();
    this.control.updateValueAndValidity();
  }
}

onFileRemoved() {
  if (this.doReview && this.control) {
    this.control.setValue(null);
    this.control.markAsTouched();
    this.control.updateValueAndValidity();
  }
}
```

#### Other Question Components
- **Text Component** (`app-text`): Text input with rich text support
- **Multiple Component** (`app-multiple`): Multiple choice questions
- **Oneof Component** (`app-oneof`): Single choice questions
- **Team Member Selector** (`app-team-member-selector`): Team member selection

All follow similar patterns with dual-purpose display for learner/reviewer contexts.

### 4. Bottom Action Bar (`bottom-action-bar.component.html`)

**Purpose**: Provides the primary action button for assessment submission/continuation

**Key Features:**
```html
<ion-button class="action-button"
  mode="ios"
  [disabled]="loading || (disabled$ | async)"
  [color]="color"
  (click)="onClick($event)"
  [attr.aria-busy]="loading ? 'true' : 'false'">
  <ion-spinner *ngIf="loading" name="crescent"></ion-spinner>
  <span>{{ text }}</span>
</ion-button>
```

**Button States:**
- **Enabled**: Form is valid and user can submit
- **Disabled**: Form has validation errors or an action is already in progress
- **Loading**: For assessment/review submit actions, starts before the click event is emitted, keeps the disabled button visible with an inline spinner, and clears when `disabled$` emits `false`
- **Dynamic Text**: Changes based on context (Submit, Continue, Mark as Read, etc.)

`disabled$` remains the source of truth for whether the action can be triggered. Loading is a distinct, opt-in visual state (`showLoadingOnClick`) so validation-disabled buttons do not incorrectly announce `aria-busy`, and non-submit actions retain their existing behavior.

During manual submission, the parent page owns the terminal `disabled$ = false` transition. Intermediate assessment/review refetches may update displayed data and the last-saved message, but must not re-enable the action while the assessment component's submission guard is active. The parent clears the state only after the final refresh succeeds or the submission fails.

## Data Flow Diagrams

### Assessment Submission Flow (Learner)

```
1. Activity Desktop Page
   ↓ (Load Assessment)
2. AssessmentService.fetchAssessment()
   ↓ (GraphQL Query)
3. Assessment Component receives data
   ↓ (Initialize form)
4. Question Components populate with answers
   ↓ (User interaction)
5. Form validation triggers
   ↓ (Valid form)
6. Bottom Action Bar enabled
   ↓ (User clicks submit)
7. Assessment Component emits save event
   ↓ (Handle save)
8. Activity Desktop Page calls AssessmentService.submitAssessment()
   ↓ (API call)
9. Success: Navigate to next task
```

### Review Submission Flow (Reviewer)

```
1. Review Desktop Page
   ↓ (Select Review)
2. AssessmentService.fetchAssessment() with action='review'
   ↓ (GraphQL Query with reviewer=true)
3. Assessment Component receives:
   - Assessment structure
   - Learner submission (reference)
   - Review data (editable)
   ↓ (Initialize form)
4. Question Components show:
   - Learner answers (read-only)
   - Reviewer input fields (editable)
   ↓ (Reviewer interaction)
5. Form validation for reviewer fields
   ↓ (Valid review form)
6. Bottom Action Bar enabled
   ↓ (Reviewer clicks submit)
7. Assessment Component emits save event
   ↓ (Handle review save)
8. Review Desktop Page calls AssessmentService.submitReview()
   ↓ (API call)
9. Success: Update review list
```

## Form Validation System

### Validation Rules

**Required Field Logic:**
```typescript
// Only apply required validation when user can edit
if (this._isRequired(question) === true) {
  validator = [Validators.required];
}

private _isRequired(question: Question): boolean {
  if (!question.isRequired) return false;
  
  // Learner doing assessment
  if (this.doAssessment && question.audience.includes('submitter')) {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Reviewer doing review
  if (this.isPendingReview && question.audience.includes('reviewer')) {
    return true;
  }
  
  return false;
}
```

**Button State Management:**
```typescript
// Delayed subscription to avoid race conditions during initialization
setTimeout(() => {
  this.questionsForm.valueChanges.pipe(
    takeUntil(this.unsubscribe$),
    debounceTime(300),
  ).subscribe(() => {
    this.initializePageCompletion();
    this.setSubmissionDisabled();
  });
}, 300);

setSubmissionDisabled() {
  // only enforce form validation when user can actually edit
  if (!this.doAssessment && !this.isPendingReview) {
    return;
  }
  
  this.btnDisabled$.next(this.questionsForm.invalid);
}
```

### Validation Flow for Required File Questions

**Scenario**: Reviewer must upload a file for a required question

1. **Form Setup**:
   ```typescript
   // question.isRequired = true, question.audience = ['reviewer']
   // isPendingReview = true (reviewer can edit)
   const validator = [Validators.required];
   this.questionsForm.addControl('q-' + question.id, new FormControl('', validator));
   ```

2. **Initial State**:
   - Form control value: `null` or `''`
   - Form validity: `invalid`
   - Button state: `disabled`

3. **File Upload**:
   ```typescript
   // File upload component updates control
   this.control.setValue(fileObject);
   this.control.updateValueAndValidity();
   ```

4. **Validation Update**:
   - Form control value: `fileObject`
   - Form validity: `valid`
   - Button state: `enabled`

## Assessment Pagination System

### Core Properties
```typescript
pageSize = 10;                          // maximum questions per page
pageIndex: number = 0;                  // current page (0-based)
pagesGroups: any[] = [];               // pages containing question groups
pageRequiredCompletion: boolean[] = []; // completion status per page (required questions answered?)
pageVisited: boolean[] = [];            // whether the user has navigated to each page
readonly manyPages = 10;               // minimum pages to show scrollable pagination
```

#### page indicator state model

| `pageVisited[i]` | `pageRequiredCompletion[i]` | visual state |
|---|---|---|
| `false` | any | plain number (neutral — not yet visited) |
| `true` | `true` | green checkmark (visited + required complete) |
| `true` | `false` | plain number (neutral — visited but incomplete; no red) |

- on first load, only page 0 is marked visited.
- pages are marked visited when the user navigates to them via `prevPage()`, `nextPage()`, or `goToPage()`.
- `pageVisited` is reset to `[]` in `ngOnChanges` whenever `assessment`, `submission`, or `review` changes.
- in read-only mode all pages are marked visited (all indicators show green).

### Page Generation Logic
```typescript
splitGroupsByQuestionCount() {
  // Team360: returns one page per configured group, preserving group order
  // Other assessment types:
  // - Multiple small groups can fit on one page if total questions ≤ pageSize
  // - Large groups with >pageSize questions are split across multiple pages
}
```

### Navigation Methods
```typescript
prevPage()              // go to previous page; marks destination as visited
nextPage()              // go to next page; marks destination as visited
goToPage(i: number)     // jump to specific page; marks target as visited
```

For Team360, these methods navigate through `accessiblePageIndexes` rather than assuming every
integer page between `0` and a maximum is accessible. This allows navigation to skip unused member
placeholder pages while preserving selector-free groups anywhere in the configured order.

### Team360 Semantic Completion

Team360 progress is group-based and each configured group has its own physical page. Page meaning
is derived from its questions rather than its position:

1. a selector-bearing group is a member-review page;
2. a selector-free group is a non-peer page, including general and self-assessment groups;
3. physical pages retain their configured order, so any number of non-peer pages can appear before,
   between, or after member-review pages.

- `team360Sections` is the ordered classification of configured groups as peer or non-peer pages.
- `team360MemberCount` remains the distinct-member cap derived from selector options across all group positions.
- `team360MemberSections` contains the actual selector-bearing groups, capped by that distinct-member count.
- `team360RequiredMemberCount` is `1` when at least one member-review section exists: the first
  selector-bearing peer group is the minimum required review.
- `team360MemberReviewCount` is the total number of accessible member-review sections shown in progress.
- `team360PagesVisited` counts member sections that were visited and have an actual member selection;
  opening an empty peer page does not count as a completed review.
- later selector-bearing peer groups remain available and contribute to progress when completed, but
  they do not replace or bypass the required first peer review.
- groups without a team-member selector never increase the "members reviewed" counter.

Submit-button state is calculated as:

```text
disabled = assessment form invalid
        OR first peer review incomplete
        OR any accessible Team360 page has an unanswered required question
```

Required completion is checked across all accessible Team360 pages, regardless of which physical
page is currently displayed. Required leading or trailing non-peer questions therefore block
submission from every page until answered; entirely optional non-peer groups add no submission gate.

### Completion Tracking

completion tracking is gated on `pageVisited` so optional-only pages never show false-positive red indicators.

```typescript
ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {
  if (!this.assessment) {
    return;
  }

  this._initialise();

  if (changes.assessment || changes.submission || changes.review) {
    this.pageRequiredCompletion = [];
    this.pageVisited = [];           // reset visited state on new assessment/submission

    this._handleSubmissionData();
    this._populateQuestionsForm();
    this._handleReviewData();
    this._prefillForm();
  }

  if (this.isPaginationEnabled) {
    this.pagesGroups = this.splitGroupsByQuestionCount();
    this.pageIndex = 0;

    setTimeout(() => {
      this.initializePageCompletion();
    }, 200);
  } else {
    this.pagesGroups = [];
    this.pageIndex = 0;
  }

  setTimeout(() => this.scrollActivePageIntoView(), 250);
}

initializePageCompletion() {
  if (!this.isPaginationEnabled) return;

  if (!this.doAssessment && !this.isPendingReview) {
    // read-only mode: mark everything visited and complete
    this.pageRequiredCompletion = new Array(this.pageCount).fill(true);
    this.pageVisited = new Array(this.pageCount).fill(true);
    this.cdr.detectChanges();
    setTimeout(() => this.scrollActivePageIntoView(), 100);
    return;
  }

  this.pageRequiredCompletion = new Array(this.pageCount).fill(true);

  // only initialise visited array on first call; preserve state on re-runs (e.g. form value changes)
  if (!this.pageVisited.length) {
    this.pageVisited = new Array(this.pageCount).fill(false);
    this.pageVisited[0] = true;        // page 0 is always visited on load
  }

  this.pages.forEach((page, index) => {
    const pageQuestions = this.getAllQuestionsForPage(index);
    this.pageRequiredCompletion[index] = this.areAllRequiredQuestionsAnswered(pageQuestions);
  });

  this.setSubmissionDisabled();
  this.cdr.detectChanges();
  setTimeout(() => this.scrollActivePageIntoView(), 100);
}
```

### Problem: Stale Completion State on First Load

**Issue Description:**
Page indicators could show an incorrect state on first load of assessments, even when questions were already answered. This occurred due to a timing mismatch between form population and completion tracking initialization.

**Root Cause:**
The `initializePageCompletion()` method was being called before form values were fully populated, causing `areAllRequiredQuestionsAnswered()` to return false for completed questions.

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Moved completion initialization to proper lifecycle hook:**
   ```typescript
   // In ngOnChanges(), after pagination setup
   setTimeout(() => {
     this.initializePageCompletion();
   }, 200);
   ```

2. **Added change detection trigger:**
   ```typescript
   initializePageCompletion() {
     // ... completion logic ...
     this.cdr.detectChanges(); // Ensure view updates
   }
   ```

3. **Separated form population logic:**
   ```typescript
   private _prefillForm(): void {
     // Form population with proper validation state management
     // Called before completion tracking
   }
   ```

4. **Delayed form valueChanges subscription:**
   ```typescript
   setTimeout(() => {
     this.questionsForm.valueChanges.pipe(
       takeUntil(this.unsubscribe$),
       debounceTime(300),
     ).subscribe(() => {
       this.initializePageCompletion();
       this.setSubmissionDisabled();
     });
   }, 300);
   ```

**Result:**
Page indicators now correctly show completion status on first load, with proper visual feedback for answered and unanswered required questions.

### Unvisited-pages confirmation guard (Team 360 early-submit prevention)

**context:** in Team 360 assessments, the first N question groups (pages) contain required questions for mandatory team members; additional pages contain optional questions for extra members. once the required pages are answered the form becomes valid and the submit button enables — but the learner may not have visited the optional pages. clicking submit at that point would silently skip feedback for the remaining team members.

**solution (`assessment.component.ts:continueToNextTask()`):**

```
continueToNextTask() is now async
↓
on submit action, check: isPaginationEnabled && pageCount > 1 && any pageVisited[i] === false
↓
if unvisited pages exist → present AlertController dialog
  "Review pages" → goToPage(firstUnvisited); cancel submission
  "Submit anyway" → proceed to _doSubmit()
↓
if no unvisited pages → proceed directly to _doSubmit()
```

relevant source: `projects/v3/src/app/components/assessment/assessment.component.ts` — `continueToNextTask()`, `_doSubmit()`, `_confirmSubmitWithUnvisitedPages()`

**the guard is generic** — it fires for any multi-page assessment where the learner has not visited every page, not just Team 360. zero friction when all pages have been visited.

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- Form validation prevents submission when required fields are empty
- Visual indicators show which fields need attention
- Real-time validation feedback as user types/selects

### Network Errors
- Auto-save failures trigger retry mechanism
- Submission failures show error messages
- Automatic logout if JWT token expires

### File Upload Errors
- Upload failures with retry mechanisms
- File size and type validation
- Progress indicators during upload

## Security Considerations

### Role-Based Access
- Questions can specify audience: `['submitter', 'reviewer']`
- Form controls only editable based on user role and submission status
- API validates user permissions before allowing actions

### Data Integrity
- Form validation ensures required fields are completed
- Server-side validation confirms data integrity
- Optimistic updates with rollback on failure

## Performance Optimizations

### Change Detection
```typescript
changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
```

### Observable Management
```typescript
takeUntil(this.unsubscribe$)  // Prevent memory leaks
debounceTime(300)             // Reduce validation frequency
shareReplay(1)                // Cache service responses
```

### Lazy Loading
- Question components loaded on demand
- Assessment data fetched when needed
- Pagination reduces DOM complexity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Pagination Issues

1. **Page indicators show as incomplete on first load:**
   - **Cause**: `initializePageCompletion()` called before form values are set
   - **Solution**: Ensure proper timing in `ngOnChanges()` with delays

2. **Form validation not working correctly:**
   - **Cause**: Race condition between form population and validation setup
   - **Solution**: Use `_prefillForm()` method with proper sequencing

3. **Change detection not triggering:**
   - **Cause**: OnPush change detection strategy requires manual triggering
   - **Solution**: Call `this.cdr.detectChanges()` after completion updates

4. **Button state incorrect on load:**
   - **Cause**: Button state set before form is properly initialized
   - **Solution**: Use `setSubmissionDisabled()` method with proper conditions

5. **Completion indicators showing in read-only mode:**
   - **Cause**: Completion tracking running when user is viewing feedback/completed submissions
   - **Solution**: Check `doAssessment` and `isPendingReview` flags before running completion logic


## Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests
- Mock assessment service responses
- Test form validation logic
- Verify button state changes
- Component interaction testing
- Test pagination initialization timing

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end assessment submission flow
- Review workflow testing
- File upload functionality
- Cross-browser compatibility

### Test Scenarios
1. **Learner Assessment Flow**:
   - Start new assessment
   - Save progress (auto-save)
   - Submit assessment
   - View feedback

2. **Reviewer Flow**:
   - View learner submission
   - Provide feedback
   - Submit review
   - Handle required fields

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Network interruptions
   - Invalid file uploads
   - Session timeouts
   - Concurrent submissions

## Configuration

### Environment Features
```typescript
environment.featureToggles.assessmentPagination  // Enable/disable pagination
```

### Question Types
- `text` - Text input
- `file` - File upload
- `video` - Video file upload
- `oneof` - Single choice
- `multiple` - Multiple choice
- `team-member-selector` - Team member selection
- `multi-team-member-selector` - Multiple team member selection

## API Integration

### GraphQL Queries
```graphql
query getAssessment($assessmentId: Int!, $reviewer: Boolean!, $activityId: Int, $contextId: Int!, $submissionId: Int) {
  assessment(id:$assessmentId, reviewer:$reviewer, activityId:$activityId, submissionId:$submissionId) {
    id name type description dueDate isTeam pulseCheck allowResubmit
    groups {
      name description
      questions {
        id name description type isRequired hasComment audience fileType
        choices { id name explanation description }
        teamMembers { userId userName teamId }
      }
    }
    submissions(contextId:$contextId) {
      id status completed modified locked
      submitter { name image team { name } }
      answers { questionId answer file { name url type } }
      review {
        id status modified meta
        reviewer { name }
        answers { questionId answer comment file { name url type size } }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Mutation Operations
- `submitAssessment` - Learner submission
- `submitReview` - Reviewer feedback
- `saveAnswers` - Auto-save progress
